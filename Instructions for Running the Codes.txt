As the codes are writen in Python, you need to install the following things to run the simulations:

(The simulations are done on windows 8 pc)

1. Python 2.7
2. Numpy
3. Scipy
4. Matplotlib
5. Gcc Compiler
6. QuTiP 3.1.0


** You can get 1-5 in Pythonxy for windows


# Run single_photon_1 for getting the verification for the single photon source and detailed system dynamics

# Run single_photon_2 for getting the state tomography and mapping of state from qubit state to photon state

** Codes are appropriately commented
